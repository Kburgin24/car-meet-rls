  "Description":"There once was a boy named Ricky. He loved fast and the furious so much he would watch the series as much as he could. He would say "When i get older I'm gonna own the streets!!!". Forward to 2015 Ricky is now old enough to drive but sadly has no money, works as a pizza delivery driver using his grandmothers car, and goes to college. A couple weeks go by and sadly his grandmother passes, leaving him 20 thousand dollars for collage. With no experience and nothing but his wit he takes the money and turns his grandmothers car into a complete rocket..... so he thinks. Ricky now prowls the street looking for anyone to challenge him.",
